      This dealership has multiple <a href="Content.html">cars</a>, including Chrysler PT Cruisers! which is the only good car. And Toyota MR2s, but MR2s just really aren't cool these days.
    <br>
    <br>
      This dealership will bring you so many fun experiences! Like our buying a car from our fantastic sale representitive "Aldon Hilter" as he 
      only tries to sell you a Volkswagon and unpolitely refuses to sell anything else. In the words of a certain person: "This is guy is a melter"
    <br>
    <br>
      Some of the <a href="Guns.html">Specials</a> are: the Countach, the Transit, the Miata, the Focus and most important and the deadliest of all: the Pink Yaris. 
      Not many people know that every Pink Yaris is sent from the deepst circle of Hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all enternity.
    <br>
    <br>
      On your journey to purchase a car, you will encounter rust, blown head gaskets, stolen cars, broken cars, cars that will make you realize that Wang Cars causes metaphysical 
      subnormality or at least will make you consider that being true. But the worst of all: cars that break 5 minutes after buying them with no warranty.<br>
    <br>
      There are a lot of mods for our cars: like wings, bodykits, rims, coilovers, and a lot of other stuff. I almost forgot to mention the paint shop: every single car can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. 
      Every car's paint is different and has a different price ranging from your generic biege to a Violet Magneta Metallic.<br>
